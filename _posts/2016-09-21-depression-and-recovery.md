This is going to be a long post. I appreciate you if you read the whole thing. Some of you already know what I'm about to say, because I haven't exactly been a quiet person about my mental health, but I suffer from pretty severe depression and anxiety. At the end of August, I hit the lowest point I've ever been at. A period I'm referring to as my "rock bottom" because it's the point in which I finally made a decision about seeking real, clinical help for my problems.

I kind of just looked up one day and realized how bad I was. I was literally barely functional as a human being. It was having a huge negative impact on my work, my interactions with my wife and son, as well as my friends. I was making a lot of brash and impulsive decisions. Getting angry really easily. And generally just being very unproductive with my time. I had developed some really detrimental habits that were exacerbating things, as well.

At the beginning of September, I finally sought out help from a specialist. I had my first psychiatrist appointment. It was a long conversation and I appreciate the detail in which she teased stuff out of my brain and really paid attention to what I was saying in order to dig deeper and ask followup questions. At the end of it, she told me that she believed what I was experiencing was not quite the clinical definition of Bipolar II, but that's what I was close to. I've had lots of issues with anxiety and an inability to focus, so I was thinking ADD/Anxiety when I arrived, but her assessment was that trying to treat the ADD-like symptoms would only make me worse. She gave me a prescription.

It took close to a week to get the prescription filled because of issues with insurance, in-network vs out-of-network pharmacies, and approved drugs. I also came down with a really nasty cold right after that appointment which, combined with the rest of my depression, pretty much completely knocked me out for its duration. But, I finally got the meds and started them last Friday.

Saturday was ... bad. The instructions on the meds were to take them before bed, so I tried to take them literally as I was going to sleep with no food ... at 5:30 am, because one of my symptoms is actually an inability to make myself get up and go to bed until I'm literally passing out in my chair. The meds made me ... groggy. And loopy. I had trouble walking. I couldn't even take the dogs out. We kind of panicked and wanted to replace them because of how they were making me feel and actually got advice from a few people to do so, but I didn't really tell anyone the context of how I took them, at first. I felt like the context mattered, so I wanted to try one more time at a decent time, with food, to see how they affected me. So, Saturday night, I took my second dose.

Sunday was ... different. Noticeably different. The nagging thoughts of being a failure were gone. The constant fear that I was going to lose everything I had worked for was gone. For the first time, probably ever, I went to a social event that wasn't about tech with mostly people I didn't know and wasn't panicking. I actually enjoyed myself. I came home and worked for a while and was actually able to get some work done. I took my meds at my new standard time.

Monday was ... amazing. I had a real work day for the first time in months and actually had a really productive day. There's a very noticeable improvement in my mood, by this point.

Yesterday was ... somehow even better. I finally made my way back downtown to work out of Canvs and see some of my friends who I missed quite a lot. Several people told me I seemed different. I explained to a few what had happened. They were all incredibly supportive. You know who you are. I love you dearly. Seriously: Thank you. I felt so good yesterday that I went to OrlandoJS, my first Meetup in more than 2 months and even made the decision to do a lightning talk! Which I wrote on the spot, based on a bunch of material I commonly rant about in #career-advice on the ODevs Slack. Like my other rants, it was long and didn't fit into the 5 minutes that was given to me. And it's been a while since I've done a talk, so I got nervous. But it was a good nervous. I had fun. It felt good to get up and speak again.

I'm now on day 5 of the new medication and still feel really, really good, so I feel comfortable enough to say that it seems to be working. I'm really looking forward to what I can do with this newfound clarity. I went through a lot and was mentally not all here for ... probably the last few years, to be honest.

A couple special shoutouts since this is too long, anyway. Obviously, my wife for putting up with all of this and being so amazing and supportive. Sergio for being such a great friend during all of this. Susanna and Brian from TIY for always making me feel apart of TIY family and being there whenever I needed to rant about something or get advice from more level-headed people. And a whole host of people that would probably make this take way too long to read or write. Seriously, I have some of the best friends anyone could ask for and I'm really lucky to know all of you.

One final thing: If any of what I said or have said about my problems sounds really familiar, seriously consider going and getting some kind of help. It's life changing. Please don't hesitate. I never got so low as to think about any permanent solutions to my problems, but I can completely understand how somebody could. Don't get that low. Get help. Please.

I love all of you. Thank you for reading this.
