Summary:

Junior Developers are good for companies because they help strengthen organizational and development processes to account for the inherent weaknesses from developer inexperience. Junior Developers force companies to:

- Build and maintain good documentation so newer developers can acclimate more easily
- Build and maintain good software development processes that allow all Devs, Juniors included, to thrive and be productive
- Put in place a culture and value of mentoring and training to help Developers advance their careers
