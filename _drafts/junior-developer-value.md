Summary:

Junior Developers are good for companies because they help strengthen the organizational and development processes to account for the inherent weaknesses from their inexperience. Junior Developers force companies to:

- Build and maintain good documentation so newer developers can acclimate
- Build and maintain good software development processes that allow Jr Devs to thrive
- Put in place a culture and value of mentoring and training to help Developers advance their careers
