You've heard the horror stories surrounding development. 80+ hour weeks and having to stay up until ungodly hours on the weeks leading up to some arbitrary finish line. Setting a release date is hugely important for helping establish a cadence to your process and team, but the release date should help you establish some clarity in your development goals. Too many teams use the release date as an impenetrable wall. Worse, they rarely understand the true cost of a delayed cycle.



- What causes the death march?
- How do agile processes help combat the death march?
- What's the purpose of rapid iteration and tight feedback loops?
- Non-technical business people are really bad at prioritizing technical decisions.
- Technical people who aren't business-savvy are really bad at determining the business impact of technical decisions.
- Humans, in general, are really bad at estimating the time length of a unit of work.
  - Not technical people are **really bad** at estimating the time length of technical units of work.
