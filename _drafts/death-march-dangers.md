You've heard the horror stories surrounding development. 80+ hour weeks and having to stay up until ungodly hours on the weeks leading up to some arbitrary finish line. Setting a release date is hugely important for helping establish a cadence to your process and team, but the release date should help you establish some clarity in your development goals. Too many teams use the release date as an impenetrable wall. Worse, they rarely understand the true cost of a delayed cycle.

### What causes the death march?

A lot of technology companies are, like most businesses, sales-led organizations. A sales person will make a commitment in the interest of making the sale and getting a new client's business. Those commitments are frequently not grounded in any kind of reality around technical execution. **There is nothing inherently wrong with a sales-led approach.** The problem generally comes from lack of thorough communication between Sales and Engineering. That communication breakdown very frequently causes animosity between the two groups so neither end up willing to take steps to improve the situation for the other.

### Humans are really bad at estimating tasks in increments of time

We tend to overestimate our ability to complete things within certain timeframes. While we frequently tend to base our estimating around historical evidence from work we've done in the past, the part that a lot of people always tend to leave out is that work-time does not always cleanly align with wall-clock time. A task estimated at four hours to complete isn't necessarily going to be finished by 4 o'clock if it was started at noon. Distractions, interruptions, unexpected delays all combine to frequently make a "four hour task" take up to "an entire day" to complete.

- How do agile processes help combat the death march?
- What's the purpose of rapid iteration and tight feedback loops?
- Non-technical business people are really bad at prioritizing technical decisions.
- Technical people who aren't business-savvy are really bad at determining the business impact of technical decisions.
- Humans, in general, are really bad at estimating the time length of a unit of work.
  - Not technical people are **really bad** at estimating the time length of technical units of work.
