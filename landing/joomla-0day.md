  A major Joomla security vulnerability was just fixed. You need patch immediately. I can help.
---

An update was just released for [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org) to fix a critical security vulnerability that will allow attackers to remotely execute code on your server. This is the worst kind of vulnerability and savvy attackers very likely already have tools to scan to find vulnerable sites.

More info on the Joomla release: [Joomla! 3.4.6 Released](https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5641-joomla-3-4-6-released.html)

| Service | Description | Total Cost |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Patch Joomla Install | Simple one and done deal. I'll patch your Joomla install and make sure it's up-to-date with the latest fixes. | $350 per Joomla install |
| Patch + Server Audit | I'll patch your Joomla install, but I'll also perform an audit of your server to see if it was compromised and give you a report on my findings and suggested next steps. | $1000 per Joomla install |
| Maintenance Agreement | I'll patch your Joomla install, but we'll also enter into a long-term agreement for me to setup monitoring and perform updates on your server as necessary whenever new Joomla releases happen or other security patches like this one are released. | $2000 per month |
